name: QLINE
syntax: >-
  <nick> [<duration> <reason>]
description: |-
  If `<duration>` and `<reason>` are specified then prevents a nickname from being used. The `<duration>` may be specified as a number of seconds or as a duration in the format 1y2w3d4h5m6s. If the duration is zero then the Q-line will be permanent.

  Otherwise, if just `<nick>` is specified, removes a reservation on a nickname.

  This command is only usable by server operators with QLINE in one of their `<class>` blocks.
example:
- description: |-
    Q-lines Adam for one day with the reason "Testing"
  text: |-
    /QLINE Adam 1d :Testing
- description: |-
    Q-lines Sadie for one day with the reason "Testing"
  text: |-
    /QLINE Sadie 86400 :Testing
- description: |-
    Removes a Q-line on Adam
