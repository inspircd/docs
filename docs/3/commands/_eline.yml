name: ELINE
syntax: >-
  <ident@host> [<duration> <reason>]
description: |-
  If `<duration>` and `<reason>` are specified then exempts an ident@host mask from being affected by other (G, K, Z, etc) X-lines. The `<duration>` may be specified as a number of seconds or as a duration in the format 1y2w3d4h5m6s. If the duration is zero then the E-line will be permanent.

  Otherwise, if just `<ident@host>` is specified, removes an exemption on an ident@host mask.

  This command is only usable by server operators with ELINE in one of their `<class>` blocks.
