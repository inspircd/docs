name: ZLINE
syntax: >-
  <ipaddr> [<duration> <reason>]
description: |-
  If `<duration>` and `<reason>` are specified then bans an IP address or CIDR range from connecting to the network. The `<duration>` may be specified as a number of seconds or as a duration in the format 1y2w3d4h5m6s. If the duration is zero then the Z-line will be permanent.

  Otherwise, if just `<ipaddr>` is specified, removes a network-wide ban on an IP address.

  This command is only usable by server operators with ZLINE in one of their `<class>` blocks.
example:
- description: |-
    Z-lines 192.0.2.1 for one day with the reason "Testing"
  text: |-
