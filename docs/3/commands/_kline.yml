name: KLINE
syntax: >-
  <ident@host> [<duration> <reason>]
description: |-
  If `<duration>` and `<reason>` are specified then bans an ident@host mask from connecting to the local server. The `<duration>` may be specified as a number of seconds or as a duration in the format 1y2w3d4h5m6s. If the duration is zero then the K-line will be permanent.

  Otherwise, if just `<ident@host>` is specified, removes a local server ban on an ident@host mask.

  This command is only usable by server operators with KLINE in one of their `<class>` blocks.

- description: |-
    K-lines sadie@example.com for one day with the reason "Testing"
