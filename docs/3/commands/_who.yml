  A         | Show users who have an away message matching `<pattern>`.

  f         | Only show users on remote (far) servers.

  l         | Only show users on the local server.
  m         | Show users who have the modes listed in `<pattern>`. The pattern should be in the same format as a mode change e.g. +ow-i (server operators only).

  p         | Show users who are connected to a port in the `<pattern>` range (server operators only).
  r         | Show users who have a real name matching `<pattern>`.

  t         | Show users who have connected in the last `<pattern>` seconds.
  u         | Show users who have an ident (username) matching `<pattern>`.
  x         | Show sensitive data like real user hostnames and, when hideserver is enabled, real server hostnames.
