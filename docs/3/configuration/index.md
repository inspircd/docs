## Configuration

!!! note ""
    If you are configuring your server from scratch you might find the example configuration files helpful.

    These are located in `/usr/share/doc/inspircd` if using our binary packages and `./run/conf/examples` if you have built from source.

This page only lists core configuration. For details on the configuration of a specific module please refer to [the appropriate page for that module](/3/modules).
