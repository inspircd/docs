  The `<files>` tag reads one or more files, usually long text files. This tag can only be defined once.
  
  The purpose of these files depends on what field they are defined in.


  Note that files are only read on rehash, so changes are not automatically detected.

    A file used as the Message Of The Day, ie. shown to users when they connect or use the `/MOTD` command.
details: |-
  Relative paths are relative to InspIRCd's configuration directory. This is `/etc/inspircd` if installed with your package manager, and the main `conf/` directory otherwise. They are **NOT** relative to the current config file.
example: |-
  Use the file `examples/motd.txt.example` as Message Of The Day:

  ```xml
  <files motd="examples/motd.txt.example">
  ```
