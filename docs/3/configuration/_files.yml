    A file used as the message of the day, i.e. shown to users when they connect or use the `/MOTD` command.
details: |-
  All paths are relative to InspIRCd's configuration directory. This is `/etc/inspircd` if using our binary packages and defaults to `./run/conf` if you have built from source. They are **NOT** relative to the current config file.
example: |-
  Use the file `examples/motd.txt.example` as Message Of The Day:

  ```xml
  <files motd="examples/motd.txt.example">
  ```
