  The `<execfiles>` runs a shell command, and reads its output. The purpose of the output depends on what field commands are defined in.

  Note that commands are only run on rehash, so changes are not automatically detected.

    A file used as the Message Of The Day, ie. shown to users when they connect or use the `/MOTD` command.
details: |-
  The working directory of the commands is InspIRCd's configuration directory. This is `/etc/inspircd` if installed with your package manager, and the main `conf/` directory otherwise. It is **NOT** the directory of the current config file.
example: |-
  Downloads `https://www.example.com/motd.txt` and uses it as Message Of The Day:

  ```xml
  <execfiles motd="wget -O - https://www.example.com/motd.txt">
  ```
