## Extended Bans

Some [Channel modes](/3/channel-modes/) typically take a nick or `<nick>!<user>@<host>` as parameter. Extended Bans are extensions to the possible parameters, to either allow either more advanced selection of who these modes affect ("Matching" type), or change the meaning of the mode ("Acting" type).
