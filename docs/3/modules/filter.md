## The "filter" Module

### Description

This module adds the `/FILTER` command which allows server operators to define regex matches for inappropriate phrases that are not allowed to be used in channel messages, private messages, part messages, or quit messages.

### Configuration

To load this module use the following `<module>` tag:

```xml
<module name="filter">
```

#### `<filteropts>`

The `<filteropts>` tag defines settings about how the filter module should behave. This tag can only be defined once.

Name   | Type | Default Value | Description
------ | ---- | ------------- | -----------
engine | Text | *None*        | The regular expression engine to use for checking matches.

The engine field should be set to the name of a regular expression engine.

{! 3/modules/_regex_table.md !}

##### Example Usage

```xml
<filteropts engine="glob">
```

#### `<keyword>`

The `<keyword>` tag defines an inappropriate phrase. This tag can be defined as many times as required.

Name     | Type     | Default Value  | Description
-------- | -------- | -------------- | -----------
action   | Text     | none           | The action to take when a user does something that matches this filter.
duration | Duration | 0s (Permanent) | If action is set to gline then the duration that users who match filters should be G-lined for.
flags    | Text     | \*             | One or more flags that define what type of messages this filter applies to.
pattern  | Text     | *None*         | The regex pattern to match against.
reason   | Text     | *None*         | **Required!** The reason to give to users when they are being punished for doing something that matching this filter.

The action field should be set to one of the following values:

Value  | Description
------ | -----------
block  | Block the message that matched the filter and inform server operators with the `a` (announcements) snomask.
gline  | G-line the user that matched the filter.
kill   | Kill the user that matched the filter.
none   | Write the match to the log file and take no other action.
shun   | Shun the user that matched the filter (requires [the shun module](/3/modules/shun)).
silent | Block/replace the message that matched the filter.
warn   | Warn the user that matched the filter.
zline  | Z-line the user that matched the filter.

The flags field should be set to one or more of the following values:

Value | Description
----- | -----------
\*    | Enable every flag. Equivalent to `cnoPpq`.
c     | Strip color codes from messages before trying to match against filters.
n     | Match against `NOTICE` messages.
o     | Exempt server operators from matching this filter.
P     | Match against `PART` messages.
p     | Match against `PRIVMSG` messages.
q     | Match against `QUIT` messages.

</div>

G-lines unprivileged users for saying the phrase "fluffy capybara" in `PRIVMSG` and `NOTICE` messages:

```xml
<keyword pattern="*fluffy?capybara*"
         flags="nop"
         action="gline"
         duration="1h"
         reason="Fluffy capybaras are too cute for this network!">
```

### Statistics

### Special Notes

Having a high number of filters or having filters which take a long time to match can have significant impact on server performance.
