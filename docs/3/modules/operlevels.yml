  details: ""
  example: |-
    Creates two server operators, Sadie and Adam, where the former will be able to `/KILL` the latter but the latter will not be able to kill the former:

    ```xml
    <oper name="Sadie"
          ...
          level="100">

    <oper name="Adam"
          ...
          level="50">
    ```

    Creates two server operator types, NetAdmin and Helper, where the former will be able to `/KILL` the latter but the latter will not be able to kill the former:

    ```xml
    <type name="NetAdmin"
          ...
          level="100">

    <type name="Helper"
          ...
          level="50">
    ```
