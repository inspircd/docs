  what: a third-party library ([mbedTLS](https://tls.mbed.org))

description: |-
  This module allows TLS (SSL) encrypted connections using the [mbedTLS](https://tls.mbed.org) library.

configuration:
- name: <bind>
  description: |-
    This module extends [the core `<bind>` tags](/3/configuration#bind) with the following keys:
  extends: true
  added_values:
  - name: ssl
    description: |-
      *This MUST be set to the name of a mbedTLS TLS (SSL) profile to listen for secure connections with mbedTLS.*
  details: ""
  example: |-
    Listens for mbedTLS encrypted IRC connections on the *:6697 endpoint with an [SSL profile](#sslprofile) named "Clients":

    ```xml
    <bind address="*"
          port="6697"
          ...
          ssl="Clients"
          type="clients">
    ```

    Listens for mbedTLS encrypted server connections on the *:7000 endpoint with an [SSL profile](#sslprofile) named "Servers":

    ```xml
    <bind address="*"
          port="7000"
          ...
          ssl="Servers"
          type="servers">
    ```
- name: <sslprofile>
  description: |-
    The `<sslprofile>` tag defines a TLS (SSL) profile for sockets to use. This tag can be defined as many times as required.

    If no `<sslprofile>` tags are defined a default profile named `mbedtls` will be created. This profile will use the contents of the deprecated `<mbedtls>` tag if one has been defined. It is strongly recommended that you do not use this as it will be removed in a future release.

                outrecsize="2048"
                requestclientcert="yes">
    ```

special_notes: |-
  SSL profiles are not reloaded as part of a normal rehash. If you wish to reload SSL profiles you should use `/REHASH -ssl` or use [the sslrehashsignal](/3/modules/sslrehashsignal) to allow you to reload SSL profiles by sending SIGUSR1 to the InspIRCd process.

  If you are having trouble getting InspIRCd to read your .pem files then check that it has read access to the full path up to the location of them. If you are using a system that uses AppArmor you may need to edit the AppArmor profile to allow InspIRCd to read them too.
