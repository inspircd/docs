introduction: |-
  !!! warning ""
      This module is deprecated and has been [moved to inspircd-contrib](/4/moved-modules) in the next major version of InspIRCd.

      You should consider using [the ssl_gnutls module](/3/modules/ssl_gnutls) instead.

depends_on:
  what: a third-party library ([mbedTLS](https://tls.mbed.org))

description: |-
  This module allows TLS (SSL) encrypted connections using the [mbedTLS](https://tls.mbed.org) library.

configuration:
- name: bind
  description: |-
    This module extends [the core `<bind>` tags](/3/configuration#bind) with the following fields:
  extends: true
  attributes:
  - name:
      sslprofile: since 3.10.0
      ssl: 3.0.0 to 3.9.0
    type: Text

    description: |-
      *This MUST be set to the name of a mbedTLS TLS (SSL) profile to listen for secure connections with mbedTLS.*
  details: ""
  example: |-
    Listens for mbedTLS encrypted IRC connections on the *:6697 endpoint with an [TLS (SSL) profile](#sslprofile) named "Clients":

    ```xml
    <bind address="*"
          port="6697"
          ...
          sslprofile="Clients"
          type="clients">
    ```

    Listens for mbedTLS encrypted server connections on the *:7000 endpoint with an [TLS (SSL) profile](#sslprofile) named "Servers":

    ```xml
    <bind address="*"
          port="7000"
          ...
          sslprofile="Servers"
          type="servers">

    The `<mbedtls>` tag defines settings about how the ssl_mbedtls module should behave. This tag can only be defined once.

- name: sslprofile
  description: |-
    The `<sslprofile>` tag defines a TLS (SSL) profile for sockets to use. This tag can be defined as many times as required.

    If no `<sslprofile>` tags are defined, including tags for other TLS (SSL) modules, a default profile named `mbedtls` will be created. This profile will use the contents of the deprecated `<mbedtls>` tag if one has been defined. It is strongly recommended that you do not use this as it will be removed in a future release.
  attributes:
  - name: name
    type: Text
    required: true
    default: null
    description: |-
      The name of this TLS (SSL) profile. This is used in `<bind:ssl>` for incoming connections and `<link:ssl>` for outgoing server connections.

    ```

special_notes: |-
  TLS (SSL) profiles are not reloaded as part of a normal rehash. If you wish to reload TLS (SSL) profiles you should enable `<mbedtls:onrehash>`, use `/REHASH -ssl`, or load [the sslrehashsignal](/3/modules/sslrehashsignal) to allow you to reload TLS (SSL) profiles by sending SIGUSR1 to the InspIRCd process.

  If you are having trouble getting InspIRCd to read your .pem files then check that it has read access to the full path up to the location of them. If you are using a system that uses AppArmor you may need to edit the AppArmor profile to allow InspIRCd to read them too.

  If you are using Let's Encrypt and are having problems with missing intermediate certificates then make sure you are using fullchain.pem from Certbot/Dehydrated/etc in `<sslprofile:certfile>` instead of cert.pem as the latter does not contain intermediate certificates.
