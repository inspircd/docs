name: botmode

description: |-
  This module adds user mode `B` (bot) which marks users with it set as bots. This includes:

  * their `/WHOIS` response
  * `/WHO` responses
  * PRIVMSGs sent by them, using the `draft/bot` (starting with InspIRCd 3.11) and `inpircd.org/bot` tags

  Depending on your module-specific configuration this can also prevents a bot from using non-bot aliases (requires [the alias module](/3/modules/alias)) and from receiving channel history on join (requires [the chanhistory module](/3/modules/chanhistory)).

- name: <botmode>
