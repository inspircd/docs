## The "spanningtree" Module

### Description

This module allows linking multiple servers together as part of one network.

### Configuration

To load this module use the following `<module>` tag:

```xml
<module name="spanningtree">
```

#### `<autoconnect>`

The `<autoconnect>` tag defines one or more servers to attempt to connect to. This tag can be defined as many times as required.

Name   | Type     | Default Value | Description
------ | -------- | ------------- | -----------
period | Duration | *None*        | The time period to wait between server connection attempts.
server | Text     | *None*        | A space-delimited list of servers to attempt to connect to.

##### Example Usage

Automatically connects to hub1.example.com after 120 seconds, failing over to hub2.example.com and then hub3.example.com if connecting to the previous server fails:

```xml
<autoconnect period="2m"
             server="hub1.example.com hub2.example.com hub3.example.com">
```

#### `<bind>`
