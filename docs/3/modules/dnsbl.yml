  This module allows the server administrator to check the IP address of connecting users against a [DNSBL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSBL). This is useful for preventing malicious hosts from connecting to the server.

configuration:
- name: connect

    This module extends [the core `<connect>` tags](/3/configuration#connect) with the following fields:

  - name: usednsbl
    type: Boolean
    required: false
    default: 'Yes'
    description: |-
      Whether users in this connect class should be looked up in a DNSBL.
  details: ""

    Disables DNSBL lookups for users in the WebChat class:

    ```xml
    <connect name="WebChat"
             ...
             usednsbl="no">
    ```

    Matches users that have been marked by a configured DNSBL named Proxies to a ProxyUser class:

    ```xml
    <connect name="ProxyUser"
             ...
             dnsbl="Proxies">

  details: |-
    The action field should be set to one of the following values:

    Value | Description
    ----- | -----------
    GLINE | G-line users who's IP address is in the DNSBL.
    KILL  | Kill users who's IP address is in the DNSBL.
    KLINE | K-line users who's IP address is in the DNSBL.
    MARK  | Marks users who's IP address is in the DNSBL.
    ZLINE | Z-line users who's IP address is in the DNSBL.

    The type field should be set to one of the following values:

    Value   | Description
    ------- | -----------
    bitmask | DNSBL results will be compared against the [bit mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_(computing)) specified in the bitmask field to see if the IP address in question is in a DNSBL. For example, `15` would match against DNSBL result types 1, 2, 4, and 8.
    record  | DNSBL results will be compared against a numeric range of values. For example, `1-3,4,5` would match all DNSBL result types between 1 and 5.
