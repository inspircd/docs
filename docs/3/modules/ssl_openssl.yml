  what: a third-party library ([OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org))

description: |-
  This module allows TLS (SSL) encrypted connections using the [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org) library.

configuration:
- name: bind
  description: |-
    This module extends [the core `<bind>` tags](/3/configuration#bind) with the following fields:
  extends: true
  attributes:
  - name:
      sslprofile: since 3.10.0
      ssl: 3.0.0 to 3.9.0
    type: Text
    default: null
    description: |-
      *This MUST be set to the name of an OpenSSL TLS (SSL) profile to listen for secure connections with OpenSSL.*
  details: ""
  example: |-
    Listens for OpenSSL encrypted IRC connections on the *:6697 endpoint with an [TLS (SSL) profile](#sslprofile) named "Clients":

    ```xml
    <bind address="*"
          port="6697"
          ...
          sslprofile="Clients"
          type="clients">
    ```

    Listens for OpenSSL encrypted server connections on the *:7000 endpoint with an [TLS (SSL) profile](#sslprofile) named "Servers":

    ```xml
    <bind address="*"
          port="7000"
          ...
          sslprofile="Servers"
          type="servers">
    ```

- name: openssl
  description: |-
    The `<openssl>` tag defines settings about how the ssl_openssl module should behave. This tag can only be defined once.
  attributes:
  - name: onrehash
    type: Boolean
    required: false
    default: 'No'
    description: |-
      Whether TLS (SSL) profiles (see below) should be reloaded as part of a normal rehash.

  example: |-
    ```xml

    ```

- name: sslprofile
  description: |-
    The `<sslprofile>` tag defines a TLS (SSL) profile for sockets to use. This tag can be defined as many times as required.

    If no `<sslprofile>` tags are defined, including tags for other TLS (SSL) modules, a default profile named `openssl` will be created. This profile will use the contents of the deprecated `<openssl>` tag if one has been defined. It is strongly recommended that you do not use this as it will be removed in a future release.

    The crlmode field should be set to one of the following values:

    Value | Description
    ----- | -----------
    chain | Check if any certificate in the chain has been revoked.
    leaf  | Only check if the leaf certificate has been revoked.

    The hash field should be set to one of the values shown in `openssl list --digest-commands`.

    ```xml
    <sslprofile name="Clients"
                provider="openssl"

special_notes: |-
  If you are using a CA-provided certificate and key you will also need to provide a DH parameters file. This file can be generated using `openssl dhparam -out dhparams.pem 2048` and then be placed in your config directory.

  Mozilla publish [documentation on how to configure server-side TLS](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Recommended_configurations) which can be used for selecting a secure OpenSSL configuration. We recommend using the intermediate profile to allow compatibility with as many clients as possible whilst maintaining a decent level of security.

  TLS (SSL) profiles are not reloaded as part of a normal rehash. If you wish to reload TLS (SSL) profiles you should enable `<openssl:onrehash>`, use `/REHASH -ssl`, or load [the sslrehashsignal](/3/modules/sslrehashsignal) to allow you to reload TLS (SSL) profiles by sending SIGUSR1 to the InspIRCd process.

  If you are having trouble getting InspIRCd to read your .pem files then check that it has read access to the full path up to the location of them. If you are using a system that uses AppArmor you may need to edit the AppArmor profile to allow InspIRCd to read them too.
