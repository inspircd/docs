introduction: ""

depends_on:
  what: C++11-specific features and must be manually enabled at compile time.
  condition: If you are building with a C++11-compatible compiler

description: |-
  This module provides the `stdregex` regular expression engine which uses the [C++11 std::regex](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex/syntax_option_type#Constants) regular expression matching system.

configuration:
- name: <stdregex>
  description: |-
    The `<stdregex>` tag defines settings about how the regex_stdlib module should behave. This tag can only be defined once.

    ---------- | -----------
    awk        | Use the regular expression grammar used by the awk utility in POSIX.
    bre        | Use the basic POSIX regular expression grammar.
    ecmascript | Use the [modified ECMAScript regular expression grammar](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex/ecmascript).
    egrep      | Use the regular expression grammar used by the grep utility, with the -E option, in POSIX.
    ere        | Use the extended POSIX regular expression grammar.
    grep       | Use the regular expression grammar used by the grep utility in POSIX.
