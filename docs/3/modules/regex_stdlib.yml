  This module provides the `stdregex` regular expression engine which uses the [C++11 std::regex](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex/syntax_option_type#Constants) regular expression matching system.

configuration:
- name: stdregex

    bre        | Use the basic POSIX regular expression grammar.
    ecmascript | Use the [modified ECMAScript regular expression grammar](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex/ecmascript).
    egrep      | Use the regular expression grammar used by the grep utility, with the -E option, in POSIX.
    ere        | Use the extended POSIX regular expression grammar.
