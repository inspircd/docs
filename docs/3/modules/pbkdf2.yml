name: pbkdf2
description: |-
  This module allows other modules to generate [PBKDF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) hashes.
configuration:
- name: <pbkdf2>
  description: |-
    The `<pbkdf2>` tag defines settings about how the pbkdf2 module should behave. This tag can only be defined once.
  attributes:
  - name: iterations
    type: Number
    required: false
    default: '12288'
    description: |-
      The number of iterations of the hashing function that should be performed.
  - name: length
    type: Number
    required: false
    default: '32'
    description: |-
      The length of the derived key.
  details: ""
  example: |-
    ```xml
    <pbkdf2 iterations="12288"
            length="32">
    ```
- name: <pbkdf2prov>
  description: |-
    The `<pbkdf2prov>` tag defines settings for a specific hash algorithm. This tag can be defined as many times as required.
  attributes:
  - name: hash
    type: Text
    required: true
    default: None
    description: |-
      The name of the hash algorithm to configure.
  - name: iterations
    type: Number
