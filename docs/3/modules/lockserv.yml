    Disables access to the local server with an optional message.
- name: UNLOCKSERV
  param_count: 0
  syntax: None
  description: |-
    Enables access to the local server.

example_commands: |-
  Stops the local server from accepting new connections with the message "Server is under maintenance. Come back later.":

  ```plaintext
  /LOCKSERV :Server is under maintenance. Come back later.
  ```

  Opens up the local server so it accepts new connections:

  ```plaintext
  /UNLOCKSERV
  ```

special_notes: |-
  If you accidentally disconnect whilst a server is locked you can disable the lock by rehashing the server.
