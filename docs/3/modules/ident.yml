name: ident

description: |-
  This module allows the usernames (idents) of users to be looked up using the [RFC 1413 Identification Protocol](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1413.txt). This is useful for shared hosts where many users may be connecting from one IP address as it allows you to ban specific users without banning the entire provider.

    ```xml
    <connect name="BNC"
             allow="192.0.2.0/24"
