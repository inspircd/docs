name: ident

description: |-
  This module allows the usernames (idents) of users to be looked up using the [RFC 1413 Identification Protocol](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1413.txt). This mostly not necessary but can be useful for shared hosts where many users may be connecting from one IP address as it allows you to ban specific users without banning the entire provider.

configuration:
- name: connect
  description: |-
    This module extends [the core `<connect>` tags](/3/configuration#connect) with the following fields:
  extends: true
  attributes:
  - name: useident
    type: Boolean
    required: false
    default: 'Yes'
    description: |-
      Whether users in this connect class should have their usernames (idents) looked up.
  - name: requireident
    type: Boolean
    required: false
    default: 'No'
    description: |-
      Whether users must have responded to a username (ident) lookup to be assigned to this class.
  details: ""
  example: |-
    Disables username (ident) lookups for users in the WebChat class:

    ```xml
    <connect name="WebChat"
             ...
             useident="no">
    ```

    Requires users connecting from 192.0.2.0/24 to respond to username (ident) lookups to be assigned to the BNC class:

    ```xml
    <connect name="BNC"
             allow="192.0.2.0/24"
             ...
             requireident="yes">
    ```
- name: ident
  description: |-
    The `<ident>` tag defines settings about how the ident module should behave. This tag can only be defined once.
  attributes:
  - name: prefixunqueried
    type: Boolean
    required: false
    default: 'No'
    description: |-
      Whether to prefix the usernames (idents) of users in classes with ident lookups disabled.
  - name: timeout
    type: Duration
    required: false
    default: 5s
    description: |-
      The duration to timeout username (ident) lookups after.
  details: ""
  example: |-
    ```xml
    <ident prefixunqueried="no"
           timeout="5s">
    ```

special_notes: |-
  If you are also using [the cgiirc module](/3/modules/cgiirc) you should disable ident lookups for your WebIRC gateway.

  It is recommended that you only enable ident lookups for hosts that you know are shared as performing ident lookups makes connecting to a server slower.
