special_notes: |-
  Leaking your server statistics over the internet is a privacy and security risk. You should avoid doing this by either configuring [the httpd module](/3/modules/httpd) to only listen for local connections or by using [the httpd_acl module](/3/modules/httpd_acl) to restrict who can view your server configuration.
