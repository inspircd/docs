introduction: |-
  !!! warning ""
      This module has been moved to [inspircd-contrib](/3/module-manager)
      in the next major version of InspIRCd.
      You should consider using [the filter module](/3/modules/filter) instead.

description: |-
  This module allows the server administrator to define inappropriate phrases that are not allowed to be used in private or channel messages.

configuration:
- name: <badword>
  description: |-
    The `<badword>` tag defines an inappropriate phrase. This tag can be defined as many times as required.
  attributes:
  - name: text
    type: Text
    required: true

  - name: replace
    type: Text

  details: ""
  example: |-
    Replaces the phrase "wibble" with "wobble":

    ```xml
    <badword text="wibble"
             replace="wobble">

special_notes: |-
  The censor module does not support any kind of advanced (glob, regex,
  etc) matching or punishment other than message blocking. If you need that you should
  use [the filter module](/3/modules/filter) instead.

  You should take care to avoid [the Scunthorpe problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scunthorpe_problem)
  when adding badwords.
