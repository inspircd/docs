introduction: |-
  !!! warning ""
      This module has been moved to [inspircd-contrib](/3/module-manager) in the next major version of InspIRCd.

      You should consider using [the filter module](/3/modules/filter) instead.

special_notes: |-
  The censor module does not support any kind of advanced (glob, regex,
  etc) matching or punishment other than message blocking. If you need that you should
  use [the filter module](/3/modules/filter) instead.

  You should take care to avoid [the Scunthorpe problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scunthorpe_problem)
  when adding badwords.
