  description: |-
    This module does not add any new channel modes but instead extends
    channel mode `b` (ban) to allow ban masks to be suffixed with the name of a channel
    to redirect users who match the ban to.
  chars: []
  example: |-
    Redirects users matching `*!*@example.com` to #banned-channel.

    ```plaintext
    /MODE #channel +b *!*@example.com#banned-channel
    ```

special_notes: |-
  When setting a ban redirect the target channel should exist and the user setting the ban should have channel operator status in it.

  When the banredirect module is unloaded all ban redirects will be converted to normal bans.
