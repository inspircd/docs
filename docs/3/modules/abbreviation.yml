name: abbreviation

description: |-
    This module allows commands to be abbreviated by appending a full stop. For example, executing `/PRIV. #test Hello!` would expand to `/PRIVMSG #test Hello!`.

    If more than one command matches the specified abbreviation the server will respond with a list of commands that the abbreviation could possibly match.

special_notes: |-
    This module will not allow you to abbreviate aliases added by [the alias module](/3/modules/alias) as aliases are not real commands. If you wish to shorten an alias you should add a short form version of that alias.
