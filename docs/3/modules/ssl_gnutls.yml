  what: a third-party library ([GnuTLS](https://gnutls.org))

description: |-
  This module allows TLS (SSL) encrypted connections using the [GnuTLS](https://gnutls.org) library.

configuration:
- name: bind
  description: |-
    This module extends [the core `<bind>` tags](/3/configuration#bind) with the following fields:
  extends: true
  attributes:
  - name:
      sslprofile: since 3.10.0
      ssl: 3.0.0 to 3.9.0

      *This MUST be set to the name of a GnuTLS TLS (SSL) profile to listen for secure connections with GnuTLS.*
  details: ""
  example: |-
    Listens for GnuTLS encrypted IRC connections on the *:6697 endpoint with an [TLS (SSL) profile](#sslprofile) named "Clients":

    ```xml
    <bind address="*"
          port="6697"
          ...
          sslprofile="Clients"
          type="clients">
    ```

    Listens for GnuTLS encrypted server connections on the *:7000 endpoint with an [TLS (SSL) profile](#sslprofile) named "Servers":

    ```xml
    <bind address="*"
          port="7000"

    The `<gnutls>` tag defines settings about how the ssl_gnutls module should behave. This tag can only be defined once.
  attributes:
  - name: onrehash
    type: Boolean
    required: false
    default: 'No'
    description: |-
      Whether TLS (SSL) profiles (see below) should be reloaded as part of a normal rehash.

  example: |-
    ```xml

    ```

- name: sslprofile
  description: |-
    The `<sslprofile>` tag defines a TLS (SSL) profile for sockets to use. This tag can be defined as many times as required.

    If no `<sslprofile>` tags are defined, including tags for other TLS (SSL) modules, a default profile named `gnutls` will be created. This profile will use the contents of the deprecated `<gnutls>` tag if one has been defined. It is strongly recommended that you do not use this as it will be removed in a future release.
  attributes:
  - name: name
    type: Text
    required: true
    default: null
    description: |-
      The name of this TLS (SSL) profile. This is used in `<bind:ssl>` for incoming connections and `<link:ssl>` for outgoing server connections.

    description: |-
      The path to the CA in PEM format.
  - name: certfile
    type: Text

    default: cert.pem
    description: |-

  - name: crlfile

  - name: dhfile
    type: Text
    required: false
    default: dhparams.pem
    description: |-
      The path to the DH parameters in PEM format. Since InspIRCd v3.13.0 this does nothing on GnuTLS 3.6.0+.
  - name: hash
    type: Text
    required: false
    default: md5
    description: |-
      The hash algorithm used for TLS (SSL) client fingerprints.

      Whether to require that all tokens in the GnuTLS priority string are valid.
  details: |-
    The hash field should be set to one of the values shown in `gnutls-cli --list | grep ^Digests:`.

  example: |-
    ```xml
    <sslprofile name="Clients"
                provider="gnutls"

                strictpriority="no">
    ```

special_notes: |-
  If you are using a version of GnuTLS older than 3.6.0 you will also need to provide a DH parameters file. This file can be generated using `certtool --generate-dh-params --sec-param normal --outfile dhparams.pem` and then be placed in your config directory. You may need to use `gnutls-certtool` instead of `certtool` on macOS and `--bits 2048` instead of `--sec-param normal` on GnuTLS 2.x.

  TLS (SSL) profiles are not reloaded as part of a normal rehash. If you wish to reload TLS (SSL) profiles you should enable `<gnutls:onrehash>`, use `/REHASH -ssl`, or load [the sslrehashsignal](/3/modules/sslrehashsignal) to allow you to reload TLS (SSL) profiles by sending SIGUSR1 to the InspIRCd process.

  If you are having trouble getting InspIRCd to read your .pem files then check that it has read access to the full path up to the location of them. If you are using a system that uses AppArmor (such as our Debian and Ubuntu packages) you may need to edit the AppArmor profile to allow InspIRCd to read them too.

  If you are using Let's Encrypt and are having problems with missing intermediate certificates then make sure you are using fullchain.pem from Certbot/Dehydrated/etc in `<sslprofile:certfile>` instead of cert.pem as the latter does not contain intermediate certificates.
