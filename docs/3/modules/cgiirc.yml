description: |-
  This module adds the ability for IRC gateways to forward the real IP address of users connecting through them.

configuration:
- name: <cgiirc>
  description: |-
    The `<cgiirc>` tag defines settings about how the cgiirc module should behave. This tag can only be defined once.
  attributes:
  - name: opernotice
    type: Boolean
    required: false
    default: 'Yes'
    description: |-
      Whether to send a notice to snomask `w` (local) and snomask `W` (remote) when a gateway tries to change an IP address.
  details: ""
  example: |-
    ```xml
    <cgiirc opernotice="yes">
    ```

- name: <cgihost>
  description: |-
    The `<cgihost>` tag defines a specific IRC gateway. This tag can be defined as many times as required.
  attributes:
  - name: fingerprint
    type: Text
    required: false
    default: None

      **Required for the webirc type if password is not set!** The TLS (SSL) client certificate fingerprint that the WebIRC gateway will authenticate with.
  - name: mask

      The IP address or hostname of the gateway.
  - name: newident

      If the ident type is used then the value to replace usernames (idents) that contain hexadecimal-encoded IPv4 addresses.

    default: None
    description: |-
      The type of authentication that the gateway uses.

      **Required for the webirc type if fingerprint is not set!** The password that the WebIRC gateway will authenticate with.

    default: None
    description: |-
      If the webirc type is used the algorithm that the password is hashed with.
  details: |-
    !!! warning ""
        The `hash` field is currently optional but will be required in the next major version of InspIRCd when using password authentication.

    {! 3/modules/_hash_table.md !}

    The type field should be set to one of the following values:

    Value      | Description
    ---------- | -----------
    ident      | The IP address of the user will be sent in the username (ident) field in hexadecimal (IPv4 only).
    webirc     | The IP address of the user will be sent using the `/WEBIRC` command (recommended).

  example: |-
    Tells the cgiirc module that the \*.ident.gateway.example.com gateway will encode the IPv4 address of users into their username (ident).

    ```xml
    <cgihost type="ident"
             mask="*.ident.gateway.example.com"
             newident="wobble">
    ```

    Tells the cgiirc module that gateways with an IP matching 192.0.2.0/24 will send the IP address of users with the `/WEBIRC` command using TLS (SSL) client certificate fingerprint authentication:

    ```xml
    <cgihost type="webirc"
             fingerprint="bd90547b59c1942b85f382bc059318f4c6ca54c5"
             mask="192.0.2.0/24">
    ```

    Tells the cgiirc module that gateways with a hostname matching \*.webirc.gateway.example.com will send the IP address of users with the `/WEBIRC` command using password authentication:

    ```xml
    <cgihost type="webirc"
             password="$2a$10$WEUpX9GweJiEF1WxBDSkeODBstIBMlVPweQTG9cKM8/Vd58BeM5cW"
             hash="bcrypt"
             mask="*.webirc.gateway.example.com">
    ```

    This module extends [the core `<connect>` tags](/3/configuration#connect) with the following fields:
  attributes:
  - name: webirc
    type: Text
    required: false
    default: None
    description: |-
      If defined then a glob pattern to match the name of a WebIRC gateway against.
  details: ""
  example: |-
    Requires that users must be connecting via the "wibble" WebIRC gateway to use the Example class:

    ```xml
    <connect name="Example"
             ...
             webirc="wibble">

  More information about the `/WEBIRC` command is available on [the IRCv3 website](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/webirc.html).

# WEBIRC is not documented here because it is not intended to be executed by users

example_commands: |-
  Decodes 7f000001 to its human readable form:

  ```plaintext
  /HEXIP 7f000001

  Encodes 127.0.0.1 to its hex form:

  ```plaintext
  /HEXIP 127.0.0.1

  The `/WEBIRC` command should generally not be executed by users. It is intended to be an entirely internal feature which is executed automatically by gateways.
