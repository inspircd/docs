  details: |-
    The mode field should be set to one of the following values:

    Value       | Description
    ----------- | -----------
    full        | Cloak the user completely using three slices for common CIDR bans (IPv4: /16 /24 /32, IPv6: /32 /48 /64).
    half        | Cloak only the unique portion of a hostname. The last two segments of a hostname, /16 subnet of a IPv4 address, or /48 subnet of a IPv6 adddress will be visible.

  example: |-
    Cloaking using the full mode:

    ```xml
    <cloak mode="full"
           key="changeme"
           prefix="MyNet-"
           suffix=".IP"
           ignorecase="yes">
    ```

    Cloaking using the half mode:

    ```xml
    <cloak mode="half"
           key="changeme"
           prefix="MyNet-"
           suffix=".IP"
           domainparts="3"
           ignorecase="yes">

special_notes: |-
  The first `<cloak>` tag will be used for the cloak set when a user enables user mode `x` (cloak). The rest will be generated and used to check bans. This allows you to migrate cloaking mode or to change your cloaking key without breaking your bans.
