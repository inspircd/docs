special_notes: |-
  You should remember to `<include>` the file specified in `<permchannels:filename>` in your server configuration.

  It is recommended that you set channel mode +P (permanent) on channels and let InspIRCd write a configuration file rather than manually defining permanent channels in your server configuration.
