    The defaultmode field should be set to one of the following values:

    Value  | Description
    ------ | -----------
    binary | Send binary WebSocket frames to clients.
    reject | Reject connections that do not explicitly request a subprotocol.
    text   | Send text WebSocket frames to clients. This requires all text to be transcoded to UTF-8.

  example: |-
    ```xml
    <websocket proxyranges="192.0.2.0/24 198.51.100.*"
               defaultmode="text">

    ```

special_notes: |-
  The following HTTP errors are sent by this module:

   - HTTP 400 &mdash; Your WebSocket implementation has not sent the required `Origin` header.
   - HTTP 403 &mdash; You are attempting to connect from a non-whitelisted origin.
   - HTTP 501 &mdash; Your WebSocket implementation has not sent the required `Sec-WebSocket-Key` header.
   - HTTP 503 &mdash; You do not have [the sha1 module](/3/modules/sha1) loaded.

  If you add an encrypted WebSocket listener you should create a custom TLS (SSL) profile that has `requestclientcert="no"` set. This is required to allow connections to your server using Google Chrome.

  Some reverse proxy providers (e.g. Cloudflare) drop idle WebSocket connections which can cause problems with this module. It is recommended that you avoid these providers.
