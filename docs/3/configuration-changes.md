## Configuration changes since InspIRCd 2

NOTE: This document only lists breaking changes between InspIRCd 2 and InspIRCd 3. There are many backwards compatible changes that have been made which are not listed in this document.

## Changes

- The ldapauth module no longer needs to be enabled at build time but now depends on the new ldap module which does need to be enabled at build time.

- The ldapoper module no longer needs to be enabled at build time but now depends on the new ldap module which does need to be enabled at build time.

- The default for `<config:format>` has changed from `compat` to `xml`. If you have not set this value then you will need to set it to `compat` or switch all C-style `\` escapes to XML-style `&entity;` escapes.

- The `users/samode-usermodes` oper privilege is now required in order to change the user modes of other users with `/SAMODE`.

- `<cloak:key>` must now be at least 30 characters long. If your cloaking key is shorter than this you should define a stronger one in your `<cloak>` tag. You can define a second `<cloak>` tag with your old key to be used as a backup to avoid breaking any existing bans.

- `<disabled>` has been moved from the core to the new disable module. All you will need to do in order to upgrade is to load this module.

- `<gnutls:cafile>` is now relative to the config directory. Generally all you will need to do in order to upgrade is remove `conf/` from the path.

- `<gnutls:certfile>` is now relative to the config directory. Generally all you will need to do in order to upgrade is remove `conf/` from the path.

- `<gnutls:crlfile>` is now relative to the config directory. Generally all you will need to do in order to upgrade is remove `conf/` from the path.

- `<gnutls:keyfile>` is now relative to the config directory. Generally all you will need to do in order to upgrade is remove `conf/` from the path.

- `<include:file>` is now relative to the config directory. Generally all you will need to do in order to upgrade is remove `conf/` from the path.

- `<options:defaultmodes>` must now include any default prefix modes. To keep v2 behaviour add "o" to the default modes.

- `<permchanneldb:filename>` is now relative to the config directory. Generally all you will need to do in order to upgrade is move `permchannels.conf` to `conf/` and remove `data/` from the path.

- `<sasl:target>` is now required. The module cannot be loaded unless a target is supplied.

- `<type:name>` can now contain spaces. Any underscores in the type name will no longer be replaced with spaces. To keep v2 behaviour replace any underscores with spaces.
