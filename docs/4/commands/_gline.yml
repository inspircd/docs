name: GLINE
oper_only: true
syntax: >-
  <user@host>[,<user@host>]+ [[<duration>] <reason>]
description: |-
  If `<user@host> and `<reason>` are specified then bans an user@host mask from connecting to the network. The `<duration>` may be specified as a number of seconds or as a duration in the format 1y2w3d4h5m6s. If the duration is zero or (since v4.6.0) is not specified then the G-line will be permanent.

  Otherwise, if just `<user@host>` is specified, removes a network-wide ban on an user@host mask.
