special_notes: |-
  If you are using services you may find it useful to use one of the predefined service files which ship with InspIRCd.

  If you are using Anope for your services add the following tag to your configuration:

  ```xml
  <include file="&dir.example;/services/anope.example.conf">
  ```

  If you are using Atheme for your services add the following tag to your configuration:

  ```xml
  <include file="&dir.example;/services/atheme.example.conf">
  ```
