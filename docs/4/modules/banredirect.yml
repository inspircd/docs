  This module allows specifying a channel to redirect a banned user to in the ban mask.

  description: |-
    This module does not add any new channel modes but instead extends
    channel mode `b` (ban) to allow ban masks to be suffixed with the name of a channel
    to redirect users who match the ban to.
  chars: []
  example:
  - description: |-
      Redirects users matching `*!*@example.com` to #banned-channel
    text: |-
      /MODE #channel +b *!*@example.com#banned-channel

special_notes: |-
  When setting a ban redirect the target channel should exist and the user setting the ban should have channel operator status in it.

  When the banredirect module is unloaded all ban redirects will be converted to normal bans.
