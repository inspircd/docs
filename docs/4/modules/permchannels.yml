  This module adds channel mode `P` (permanent) which prevents the channel from being deleted when the last user leaves.

configuration:
- name: permchanneldb
  description: |-
    The `<permchanneldb>` tag defines settings about how the permchannels module should behave. This tag can only be defined once.
  attributes:
  - name: filename

    required: false
    default: null
    description: |-
      If defined then the location to write a permchannels configuration file to.
  - name: listmodes
    type: Boolean
    required: false
    default: 'Yes'
    description: |-
      Whether to save list modes to the permchannels configuration file.
  - name: operonly
    type: Boolean
    required: false
    default: 'Yes'
    description: |-
      Whether channel mode `P` (permanent) can only be set by server operators. Changing this is not recommended.
  - name: saveperiod
    type: Duration
    required: false
    default: 5s
    description: |-
      The time period between attempts to check whether the permchannel database needs to be written.
  - name: backoff
    type: Number
    required: false
    default: '0'
    description: |-
      The value to multiply the saveperiod by every time a save fails. When the save succeeds the period will be reset.
  - name: maxbackoff
    type: Duration
    required: false
    default: 120 * `backoff`
    description: |-
      The maximum write period that should be allowed even if incremental backoff is enabled.
  - name: writeversion
    type: Number
    required: false
    default: '2'
    description: |-
      The version of the permchannel database format to write.
  details: |-
    The format field should be set to one of the following values:

    Value | Description
    ----- | -----------
    1     | Write a database compatible with v2 or newer.
    2     | Write a database compatible with v4 or newer. This preserves the setter and set time of list modes by moving list modes to their own field.

  example: |-
    ```xml
    <permchanneldb filename="permchannels.conf"
                   listmodes="yes"

special_notes: |-
  You should remember to `<include>` the file specified in `<permchannels:filename>` in your server configuration.

  It is recommended that you set channel mode +P (permanent) on channels and let InspIRCd write a configuration file rather than manually defining permanent channels in your server configuration.
