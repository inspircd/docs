description: |-
  This module allows the server administrator to check the IP address of connecting users against a [DNSBL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSBL). This is useful for preventing malicious hosts from connecting to the server.

configuration:
- name: connect

    This module extends [the core `<connect>` tags](/4/configuration#connect) with the following fields:
  extends: true
  attributes:
  - name: dnsbl

  - name: usednsbl
    type: Boolean
    required: false
    default: 'Yes'
    description: |-
      Whether users in this connect class should be looked up in a DNSBL.

    Disables DNSBL lookups for users in the WebChat class:

    ```xml
    <connect name="WebChat"
             ...
             usednsbl="no">
    ```

    Matches users that have been marked by a configured DNSBL named Proxies to a ProxyUser class:

    ```xml
    <connect name="ProxyUser"
             ...
             dnsbl="Proxies">

    The reason field can contain any of the following template variables:

    Variable      | Description
    ------------- | -----------
    %dnsbl%       | The name of the DNSBL (from `<dnsbl:name>`)

    ------- | -----------
    bitmask | *Deprecated!* DNSBL results will be compared against the [bit mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_(computing)) specified in the bitmask field to see if the IP address in question is in a DNSBL. For example, `15` would match against DNSBL result types 1, 2, 4, and 8.
    record  | DNSBL results will be compared against a numeric range of values. For example, `1-3,4,5` would match all DNSBL result types between 1 and 5.
