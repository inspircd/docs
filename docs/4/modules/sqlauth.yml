description: |-
  This module allows connecting users to be authenticated against an arbitrary SQL table.

  It only allows checking clients are allowed to connect (the `PASS` command), and does not provide any sort of user accounts (ie. no nickname registration, NickServ, or SASL).

  example: |-
    Checks the password using the existence of a row returned from the database:

    ```xml
    <sqlauth hash="sha256"
             dbid="sqlauth"
             killreason="Access denied"
             query="SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='$nick' AND password='$sha256pass' LIMIT 1"
             verbose="no">
    ```

    Checks the password by comparing against a database field specified in the config:

    ```xml
    <sqlauth column="password"
             kdf="bcrypt"
             dbid="sqlauth"
             killreason="Access denied"
             query="SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='$nick' LIMIT 1"
             verbose="no">
    ```
