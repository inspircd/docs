## Breaking changes since InspIRCd 3

**NOTE** &mdash; This document only lists breaking changes between InspIRCd 3 and InspIRCd 4. There are many backwards compatible changes that have been made which are not listed in this document.

### System

- A compiler with C++17 support is now required to build InspIRCd. In practise this means you will need to use at least Clang 5, GCC 7, or MSVC 19.15.

- CMake 3.20+ is now required to build on Windows.

- Debian GNU/kFreeBSD is no longer supported. It is recommended that you switch to Debian GNU/Linux instead.

- GnuTLS 3.3.5+ is now required by the ssl_gnutls module.

- OpenSSL 1.1.1+ is now required by the ssl_openssl module.

- Perl 5.26+ is now required by `./configure` and all of the included Perl tools.

- Windows 10 April 2018 Update is now the minimum supported version of Windows.

### Modules

- The blockcaps module has been removed. If you wish to keep this behaviour then you should load the anticaps module instead. See the documentation in modules.example.conf for more details.

- The censor module has been moved to inspircd-contrib. In order to upgrade either remove this module from your configuration or run `./modulemanager install censor` to install it.

- The clones module has been moved to inspircd-contrib. In order to upgrade either remove this module from your configuration or run `./modulemanager install clones` to install it.

- The flashpolicyd module has been removed with no replacement. This module is no longer needed as [Flash Player has been retired by Adobe](https://web.archive.org/web/20170801000737/https://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2017/07/adobe-flash-update.html).

- The hostchange module has been moved to inspircd-contrib. In order to upgrade either remove this module from your configuration, run `./modulemanager install hostchange` to install it, or migrate to the [`cloak_static`](/4/modules/cloak_static) module and/or the [`cloak_user`](/4/modules/cloak_user) module.

- The lockserv module has been moved to inspircd-contrib. In order to upgrade either remove this module from your configuration or run `./modulemanager install lockserv` to install it.

- The modenotice module has been moved to inspircd-contrib. In order to upgrade either remove this module from your configuration or run `./modulemanager install modenotice` to install it.

- The regex_pcre module has been moved to inspircd-contrib. In order to upgrade either remove this module from your configuration, run `./modulemanager install regex_pcre` to install it, or migrate to [the regex_pcre2 module](/4/modules/regex_pcre2) which also provides the "pcre" regex engine so it should be a drop-in replacement.

### Config

- `<bind:ssl>` has been moved to `<bind:sslprofile>`. This move originally happened in v3 so if you are using a v3 config you probably don't need to do anything.

- `<cban:glob>` has been removed with no replacement (now always enabled).

- `<cgiirc:opernotice>` has been removed. If you wish to keep this behaviour you can use server operator snomask privileges instead.

- `<options:moronbanner>` has been moved to `<options:xlinemessage>`. This move originally happened in v3 so if you are using a v3 config you probably don't need to do anything.

- `inspircd-genssl` has been removed with no replacement. You should use a CA-validated certificate for your server rather than a self-signed one.
