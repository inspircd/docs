  The `<files>` tag reads one or more files. This tag can only be defined once. The purpose of these files depends on what field they are defined in.

  Note that files are only read on rehash, so changes are not automatically detected.

    A file used as the message of the day, i.e. shown to users when they connect or use the `/MOTD` command.
details: |-
  All paths are relative to InspIRCd's configuration directory. This is:

    - `/etc/inspircd` if using our UNIX binary packages.
    - `C:\Program Files\InspIRCd\conf` if using our Windows binary package.
    - `[ROOT]/run/conf` if you have built in your home directory.

  File paths are **NOT** relative to the current config file.
example: |-
  Use the file `&dir.example;/motd.example.txt` as the message of the day:

  ```xml
  <files motd="&dir.example;/motd.example.txt">
  ```
