### `/INVITE [<nick> <channel> [<duration>]]`

If `<nick>` and `<channel>` are specified then sends an invite to `<nick>` inviting them to join `<channel>`.

If `<duration>` is specified then the invite will expire after the specified duration passes. This duration can be given as a number of seconds or as a duration in the format 1y2w3d4h5m6s.

Otherwise, if no parameters are specified, then lists the invites which you have been sent that haven't been acted on yet.

#### Example Usage
