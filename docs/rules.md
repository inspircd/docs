## InspIRCd Project Rules

Like many other projects the InspIRCd project has rules that participants are expected to follow.

### Where do these rules apply?

These rules apply to all InspIRCd project spaces including but not limited to:

* The \#inspircd IRC channel on Teranova

* The \#inspircd.dev IRC channel on Teranova

* The InspIRCd testnet at testnet.inspircd.org

* The InspIRCd GitHub organisation

* The InspIRCd accounts on Bluesky and Mastodon

These rules also apply to non-InspIRCd spaces in cases where an individual is representing the InspIRCd project or where an interaction has been moved from an InspIRCd space for the purpose of rule evasion.

### What are the rules?

**TL;DR:** If youâ€™re being abusive, rude, or otherwise harmfully disruptive you will be banned.

#### General rules

* We aim to create an inclusive, harassment-free environment for all InspIRCd users. You must engage professionally, constructively, and in good faith and assume the same from others. If someone is being disruptive then you should disengage and let a member of the InspIRCd Team deal with them. If you can't or don't want to engage in this way then don't engage at all.

* Be patient with new people, especially if English is not their first language. Not everyone has the same level of skill and everyone was a new user at some point. Lecturing people on how to ask good questions or how they should RTFM is generally counterproductive. Instead, consider asking them what error they are encountering or linking them to the appropriate documentation section.

* When asking for help remember that all helpers are volunteers and may take a while to respond. You should expect to wait for a few hours for responses when people are busy. Repeatedly joining and asking the same question only to quit a few minutes later is likely to make people not want to help you so you should avoid doing this.

* Feature requests and bug reports must be filed on GitHub only. The only exception to this is that security issues must be reported following [our security policy](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/security/policy).

#### IRC-specific rules

* The purpose of \#inspircd is to support users of InspIRCd and the purpose of \#inspircd.dev is to have technical discussions about InspIRCd. Off-topic discussion is allowed in these channels but please keep it to a minimum when on-topic discussion is happening.

* If you need to paste more than three lines of text you must use a pastebin such as [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com), [PrivateBin](https://privatebin.net), or [Termbin](https://termbin.com/). We use automatic flood protection and pasting lots of text may result in you being automatically kicked and/or banned.

* Do not privately message individuals asking for support unless invited to. The fastest way of obtaining support is asking in \#inspircd and waiting for someone to help you. The only exception to this is if the channel is moderated during a bot attack you can message an op to ask to be voiced.

* Well-behaved bots are allowed but must not speak unless spoken to and must not be used for breaking these rules, ban evasion, or public logging.

### Enforcement

The InspIRCd Team are responsible for interpreting and enforcing these rules. Members of the InspIRCd Team have channel prefix modes `a` (admin) and `o` (op) on IRC and are marked as "Member" on GitHub. On IRC some people have been deputised to help enforce the rules. These people have channel prefix mode `h` (halfop).

We aim to enforce these rules fairly against everyone and may forgive people who make amends. To appeal a moderation action you can message Sadie on Teranova or email her at [sadie@witchery.services](mailto:sadie@witchery.services).

Evasion or sending abuse in response to a moderation action will result in a permanent ban.
